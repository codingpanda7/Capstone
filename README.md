# Capstone
Coding Bootcamp Capstone Project
Here are the ideas I have for my Capstone project.

1. Life/Habit trackerX
2. To Do ListX
3. Game LogX
   
 Problem: I currently use 4 different applications. one to journal, two to track my tasks, and I'm in the market for a habit tracker. I'd like to combine features from each of the task list apps in a way that's intuitive and aesthetic. I also don't have a way to go back and reflect on what I did in the past week. I'm only able to see what was completed. 
The first 2 ideas would be creating my own API, while the Game log I would use IGDB API or RAWG API and Steam works. 

I believe the game log would be really fun to work on. Every gamer has an issue with their backlog sometimes spanning more than one console. Keeping track of what game they are currently playing, those on the back burner and their thoughts on certain games all in one place. I believe this idea is my favorite.

I had a call with Sarah and we decided that I should do a budgeting app instead.
